## ROI Calculator

### Interactive Widget

**Inputs:**
1. **Monthly Leads:** Slider (50-10,000)
2. **Lead Value (Avg):** $500 (input field)
3. **Current Conversion Rate:** 5% (default)
4. **Sales Team Size:** 1-50
5. **Avg Hourly Cost:** $50 (input field)

**Calculations:**
```
Current Monthly Revenue = Leads × Conversion % × Lead Value
AI-Enhanced Conversion = Current % + 40% improvement
New Monthly Revenue = Leads × New Conversion % × Lead Value
Additional Revenue = New - Current
Annual Impact = Additional × 12

Time Saved = (Leads × 10 min/lead) × Sales Team
Annual Time Savings = Time Saved × 52 weeks
Cost Savings = Annual Time Savings × Hourly Cost

Total ROI = Additional Revenue + Cost Savings
Payback Period = Implementation Cost / (Total ROI / 12)
```

**Example Output:**
- Current: $25,000/month revenue
- With AI: $35,000/month (+$10k)
- Annual Impact: +$120,000
- Time Saved: 867 hours/year
- Cost Savings: $43,350
- **Total ROI: $163,350/year**
- **Payback: 2.8 months**

A: Most clients see 20-30% improvement in qualified leads within 4 weeks.

**Q5: What about data privacy?**
