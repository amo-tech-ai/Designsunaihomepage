## ROI Calculator Section

### Calculate Your AI ROI

**Inputs:**
- Hours spent on manual task/week
- Average hourly cost
- AI automation percentage (est. 70%)
- Implementation cost

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Hours × Hourly Cost × 52 weeks) × Automation %
ROI = (Annual Savings - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost × 100
Payback Period = Implementation Cost / (Annual Savings / 12)
```

**Example:**
- 20 hours/week manual data entry
- $50/hour cost
- 70% automation
- $30k implementation

**Result:**
- Annual Savings: $36,400
- ROI: 121% in Year 1
- Payback: 9.9 months

## FAQ Section

**Q1: Do I need a lot of data to train AI?**
A: Depends on the task. GPT-4 works with minimal data. Custom models need 1,000+ examples. We assess during discovery.

**Q2: How long until I see results?**
A: Proof-of-concept in 2-4 weeks. Production deployment in 6-12 weeks depending on complexity.

**Q3: What if the AI doesn't perform well?**
A: We benchmark accuracy during prototyping. If we can't achieve target metrics, we recommend alternative solutions or refund.

**Q4: Can you work with our existing tech stack?**
A: Yes. We integrate with any system that has an API or database connection.

**Q5: Do you handle compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)?**
A: Yes. We implement privacy controls, data encryption, and audit trails for regulated industries.

**Q6: What's the difference between GPT-4 and custom models?**
A: GPT-4 is general-purpose and fast to deploy. Custom models are trained on your data for higher accuracy on specific tasks.

**Q7: Do you provide ongoing support?**
A: Yes. All projects include 30 days of support. Ongoing maintenance available for $2.5k-$8k/month.

**Q8: Can AI replace my entire team?**
