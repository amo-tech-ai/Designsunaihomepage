## FAQ Section

**Q1: Why 8 weeks specifically?**
A: 8 weeks balances speed and quality. Faster risks cutting corners. Slower risks over-engineering. We've done this 50+ times.

**Q2: What if we need more features?**
A: We prioritize ruthlessly. Most MVPs need 1-3 core features. Additional features can be added in v1.1 (post-launch).

**Q3: Can we extend the timeline?**
A: Yes. If you need more features upfront, we can extend to 10-12 weeks and adjust pricing accordingly.

**Q4: What happens after 8 weeks?**
A: You own the code and can maintain it yourself, or hire us for ongoing support ($2.5k-$5k/month).

**Q5: Do you help with user research?**
A: We provide guidance, but user research is your responsibility. We focus on building what you define.

**Q6: Can we change features mid-project?**
A: Minor tweaks yes. Major scope changes require timeline/budget adjustment.

**Q7: What if the MVP fails?**
A: That's the point of an MVP—to test quickly. We help you learn fast, whether it succeeds or fails.

**Q8: Do you offer equity deals?**
A: No. We're a service business, not investors. Fixed-price projects only.
