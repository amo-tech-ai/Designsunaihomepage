## Multistep Prompts

### Prompt 1: Hero with Timeline Animation
> "Create hero section with headline '7-Phase Development Model: From Idea to Launch', subheadline about systematic methodology, 3 value pills (Systematic, Clear Milestones, On-Time). Center shows horizontal timeline with 7 phases (Discovery, Design, Frontend, Backend, AI, Polish, Launch). Each phase is a node connected by line. Animate phases revealing left-to-right with stagger (0.3s each). Current phase pulses. Add progress percentage (0-100%). Primary CTA 'Start Your Project'."

### Prompt 2: Phase Detail Cards
> "Build 7 expandable phase cards in vertical layout. Each card shows: phase number, name, duration (e.g., 'Week 1'), goal statement. Collapsed view shows icon + name. Clicking expands to show: activities list (4-5 bullets), deliverables checklist (5 items with checkboxes), client time required, success criteria (3 items). Use accordion animation: height auto-expand (400ms), content fade-in stagger (0.1s). Active phase highlighted with gradient border."

### Prompt 3: Client Involvement Matrix
> "Create involvement matrix table showing 7 phases with time required per phase and activities. Display as interactive table: clicking row expands to show detailed breakdown of hours by activity type (meetings, reviews, testing). Add bar chart showing time distribution across phases. Highlight total time at bottom: '30-40 hours over 8 weeks, avg 4-5 hrs/week'. Use color coding: high (orange), medium (yellow), low (green)."

### Prompt 4: Deliverables Tracker
> "Design weekly deliverables tracker with 8 weeks. Each week shows phase name and 4 deliverables with checkboxes. Add progress bar at top showing completion percentage. Checkboxes animate on click: checkmark draws (SVG path animation), row highlights green. Include 'Download Full Checklist' button. Show current week highlighted with pulse animation."

### Prompt 5: Methodology Comparison Table
> "Build comparison table: Our Process vs Traditional Agency vs Freelancer. Compare 8 aspects: Timeline, Phases, Client Involvement, Deliverables, Testing, Documentation, Post-Launch, Success Rate. Use checkmarks, X marks, and specific values. Highlight 'Our Process' column with subtle gradient background. Add hover tooltips with additional details per cell."

### Prompt 6: Interactive Process Flow
> "Create interactive process flowchart showing all 7 phases connected with arrows. Each phase is a card showing: icon, name, duration, key deliverable. Clicking phase shows modal with full details (activities, deliverables, client role). Animate flow with dotted line drawing from phase to phase (strokeDashoffset). Add 'You Are Here' marker that can be dragged to simulate project progress."
