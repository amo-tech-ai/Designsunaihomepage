## DESIGN SYSTEM NOTES

### Border Philosophy
All borders are sharp 0px border radius. No box shadows used. Visual depth created through borders and layering instead of shadows.

### Spacing Scale
Use 8px base increment: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 64px, 80px, 100px, 120px.

### Hover States
Buttons: Darken background by 10% or strengthen border by 1px. Links: Extend underline width or change color to darker amber. Cards: Add 3px border instead of 2px in #F59E0B.

### Responsive Behavior
Desktop breakpoint: 1280px+. Tablet: 768px-1279px (convert 2-3 column grids to 1-2 columns). Mobile: <768px (all multi-column layouts become single column, reduce font sizes by 15-20%, reduce padding by 30%).

### Animation Guidelines
Use subtle transitions: 0.3s ease for color changes, 0.2s ease for border changes, 0.4s ease for layout shifts. Avoid aggressive animations. Maintain calm, luxury feel.

### Accessibility Requirements
Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text. All interactive elements keyboard accessible. Focus states use 3px outline in #F59E0B. Alt text for all images. Semantic HTML structure.
